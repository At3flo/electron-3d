2) Add rubber grommets/cut rubber piping to the corners of your heatbed to reduce bed judder

3) Check if your prints are proper size with a caliper. ie. calibration box. Tighten your belt tension on all axes if that's not the case.

4) Retighten all screws on your unit including beneath the heatbed belt mount (which can come off) if prints look wonky.

5) Calibrate your E step throughput (guide here > https://www.matterhackers.com/articles/how-to-calibrate-your-extruder

6) Adjust your retraction rate if prints look off

7) Level your bed. Try to use a dedicated gauge for this

8) Calibrate your lines and scale > http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:52946

9) Print with the following settings: 190-200 degrees for nozzle and 60 for the bed for PLA. 0.2mm resolution 30% infill. Starting layer height 0.1, fan off for first layer.

10) Add support or rafting if prints have problems

11) Try materials from different makes/brands which may have different properties such as temperature and may work different to your setup.
